       <p>
       The creation of Jazz music in the early 20th centruy was a new and innovative step in American culture. Jazz was a turning point in the sense that it strayed from the straight-timed music at the time in favor for swing and syncopated rythms, and shifted popular music towards the formation of Blues, Rock, and other forms of popular music.
